## 🚀 What is Ping?

**Ping** is a **live, in-the-moment chat platform** where conversations exist only while people are present.  

**No chat history. No screenshots. No archives.**

If you leave, the conversation is gone.

Built for:
- 🎓 Colleges & classrooms  
- 🏢 Offices & teams  
- 🏠 Hostels & communities  
- 🎉 Events & meetups

## 🎯 Why Ping?

> **Most chat apps are built for permanence.**  
> **Ping is built for presence.**

<br/>

Traditional messaging platforms create pressure:

- Reply later  
- Messages stay forever  
- Conversations feel formal  

⚡ **Ping removes that pressure.**

It enables spontaneous, real-time conversations that disappear once the moment is over.

✨ *Say it. Experience it. Let it go.*

## ✨ Core Features

- ⚡ **Live Ping Rooms** (temporary chat spaces)  
- ⏱ **Auto-expiring conversations**  
- 🗳 **Timer extensions via voting**  
- 🔒 **Public ↔ Private toggle with group approval**  
- 👤 **Avatar-based identity**  
- 🔔 **Real-time notifications**  
- 📵 **No chat history — ever**  
- 📱 **Single Flutter codebase (Android | iOS | Web)**

## 🧠 How Ping Works

A Ping lives only as long as people stay engaged:

1. Users join a **Group** via invite code  
2. Anyone can **Start a Ping**  
3. Members request to join  
4. Ping runs on a **10-minute timer**  
5. Timer can be extended by **group vote**  
6. If everyone leaves → Ping self-destructs  

All messages are deleted automatically.
